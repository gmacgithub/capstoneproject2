Hello World!

I'm Gerbert.

I'm currently studying programming with the hope of using it to create games, control robots, or maybe use it in  the workplace.
Right now I have a full-time job as a Japanese deals researcher.

My Skills

Japanese Language
I started seriously studying Japanese in 2014 and I used the internet resources and apps to learn the language. I have JLPT N2 level proficiency.

Customer Service
Most of my working life was spent assisting customers with their questions about products and troubleshooting their problems.
For more than 10 years I've helped many people through this work.
